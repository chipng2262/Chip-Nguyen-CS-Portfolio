# C Program Descriptions

This repository contains my work for Lab 2 of CS50, Spring 2023 at Dartmouth College.

**chill** contains a C program to calculate and tabulate wind chill based on the current temperature and wind speed. 

**words** contains a C program that breaks its input into a series of words, one per line. It may take input from stdin, or from files whose names are listed as arguments. 

**histo** contains a C program that reads a series of positive integers from stdin, and prints out a 16-bin histogram. The histogram is scalable to include input values that are above the current limit. 

Test files and test ouput files are also included.
